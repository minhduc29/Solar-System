            <h1>Eris</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Eris is one of the largest known dwarf planets in our solar system.</p>
            <p>It's about the same size as Pluto, but is three times farther from the Sun.</p>
            <p>Eris first appeared to be larger than Pluto. This triggered a debate in the scientific community that led to the International Astronomical Union's decision in 2006 to clarify the definition of a planet. Pluto, Eris and other similar objects are now classified as dwarf planets.</p>
            <p>Eris is named for the ancient Greek goddess of discord and strife. The name fits since Eris remains at the center of a scientific debate about the definition of a planet.</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>With a radius of about 722 miles (1,163 kilometers), Eris is about 1/5 the radius of Earth.</p>
            <p>From an average distance of 6,289,000,000 miles (10,125,000,000 kilometers), Eris is about 68 AU away from the Sun.</p>
            <p>It takes sunlight more than nine hours to travel from the Sun to the surface of Eris.</p>
            <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
            <p>Eris takes 557 Earth years to make one trip around the Sun.</p>
            <p>The plane of Eris' orbit is well out of the plane of the solar system's planets and extends far beyond the Kuiper Belt, a zone of icy debris beyond the orbit of Neptune.</p>
            <p>As Eris orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 25.9 hours, making its day length similar to ours.</p>
            <h2>Formation</h2>
            <p>Dwarf planet Eris is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt.</p>
            <p>This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds, which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids.</p>
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>We know very little about Eris' internal structure.</p>
            <h2>Surface</h2>
            <p>Eris most likely has a rocky surface similar to Pluto.</p>
            <p>Scientists think surface temperatures vary from about -359 degrees Fahrenheit (-217 degrees Celsius) to -405 degrees Fahrenheit (-243 degrees Celsius).</p>
            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>The dwarf planet is often so far from the Sun that its atmosphere collapses and freezes, falling to the surface as snow.</p>
            <p>As it gets closest to the Sun in its faraway orbit, the atmosphere thaws.</p>
            <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            <p>The surface of Eris is extremely cold, so it seems unlikely that life could exist there.</p>
            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>Eris has a very small moon called Dysnomia.</p>
            <p>Dysnomia has a nearly circular orbit lasting about 16 days.</p>
            <p>This moon is named after Eris' daughter, the demon goddess of lawlessness.</p>
            <p>Dysnomia and other small moons around planets and dwarf planets allow astronomers to calculate the mass of the parent body. Dysnomia plays a role in determining how comparable Pluto and Eris are to each other.</p>
            <h2>Rings</h2>
            <p>Eris has no known rings.</p>
            <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
            <p>Nothing is known about Eris' magnetosphere.</p>
