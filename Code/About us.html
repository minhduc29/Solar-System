        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>We started this website because we believe there should be a more thorough, yet comprehensible website in this field of Astronomy!</p>
        <p>Our website aims to provide in-depth and understandable information about the Solar System, which can be beneficial to anyone who wishes to widen their knowledge in this particular area.</p>
        <p>Along the way, we have encountered some obstacles from the coding, design procedure to the selecting information process. Nevertheless, we have managed to tackle all the problems to create a useful, informative and aesthetic website that you now see!</p>
        <p>We wish to further widen your knowledge about the Solar System, and most importantly, to bring you the passion to discover more about the Solar System, and furthermore, the Universe.</p>
        <p>If you wonder why we should learn about the universe, we would put it very simple: our Universe is full of intriguing things to find out! Just imagine there is nothing bigger or older than our Universe!</p>
        <p>We would borrow a saying from Stephen Hawking, a very famous English theoretical physicist: “We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet orbiting around a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special”.</p>
        <p>We wish you have a great time using our website!</p>
        <h3>Thank You!</h3>
