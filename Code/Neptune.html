            <h1>Neptune</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system.</p>
            <p>More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye.</p>
            <p>In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.</p>
            <p>Neptune is so far from the Sun that high noon on the big blue planet would seem like dim twilight to us.</p>
            <p>The warm light we see here on our home planet is roughly 900 times as bright as sunlight on Neptune.</p>
            <p>The ice giant Neptune was the first planet located through mathematical calculations.</p>
            <p>Using predictions made by Urbain Le Verrier, Johann Galle discovered the planet in 1846.</p>
            <p>The planet is named after the Roman god of the sea, as suggested by Le Verrier</p>
            <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
            <p>With a radius of 15,299.4 miles (24,622 kilometers), Neptune is about four times wider than Earth.</p>
            <p>From an average distance of 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers), Neptune is 30 AU away from the Sun.</p>
            <p>It takes sunlight 4 hours to travel from the Sun to Neptune.</p>
            <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
            <p>One day on Neptune takes about 16 hours and Neptune makes a complete orbit around the Sun in about 165 Earth years (60,190 Earth days).</p>
            <p>Sometimes Neptune is even farther from the Sun than dwarf planet Pluto.</p>
            <p>Pluto's highly eccentric, oval-shaped orbit brings it inside Neptune's orbit for a 20-year period every 248 Earth years.</p>
            <p>This switch, in which Pluto is closer to the Sun than Neptune, happened most recently from 1979 to 1999.</p>
            <p>Pluto can never crash into Neptune, though, because for every three laps Neptune takes around the Sun, Pluto makes two.</p>
            <p>This repeating pattern prevents close approaches of the two bodies.</p>
            <p>Neptune’s axis of rotation is tilted 28 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun, which is similar to the axial tilts of Mars and Earth.</p>
            <p>This means that Neptune experiences seasons just like we do on Earth; however, since its year is so long, each of the four seasons lasts for over 40 years.</p>
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Uranus).</p>
            <p>Most (80 percent or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials - water, methane and ammonia - above a small, rocky core.</p>
            <p>Of the giant planets, Neptune is the densest.</p>
            <p>Scientists think there might be an ocean of super hot water under Neptune's cold clouds.</p>
            <p>It does not boil away because incredibly high pressure keeps it locked inside.</p>
            <h2>Formation</h2>
            <p>Neptune took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago, when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this ice giant.</p>
            <p>Like its neighbor Uranus, Neptune likely formed closer to the Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago.</p>
            <h2>Surface</h2>
            <p>Neptune does not have a solid surface.</p>
            <p>Its atmosphere (made up mostly of hydrogen, helium and methane) extends to great depths, gradually merging into water and other melted ices over a heavier, solid core with about the same mass as Earth.</p>
            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium with just a little bit of methane.</p>
            <p>Neptune's neighbor Uranus is a blue-green color due to such atmospheric methane, but Neptune is a more vivid, brighter blue, so there must be an unknown component that causes the more intense color.</p>
            <p>Neptune is our solar system's windiest world.</p>
            <p>Despite its great distance and low energy input from the Sun, Neptune's winds can be three times stronger than Jupiter's and nine times stronger than Earth's.</p>
            <p>These winds whip clouds of frozen methane across the planet at speeds of more than 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 kilometers per hour).</p>
            <p>Even Earth's most powerful winds hit only about 250 miles per hour (400 kilometers per hour).</p>
            <p>In 1989 a large, oval-shaped storm in Neptune's southern hemisphere dubbed the "Great Dark Spot" was large enough to contain the entire Earth.</p>
            <p>That storm has since disappeared, but new ones have appeared on different parts of the planet.</p>
            <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
            <p>The main axis of Neptune's magnetic field is tipped over by about 47 degrees compared with the planet's rotation axis.</p>
            <p>Like Uranus, whose magnetic axis is tilted about 60 degrees from the axis of rotation, Neptune's magnetosphere undergoes wild variations during each rotation because of this misalignment.</p>
            <p>The magnetic field of Neptune is about 27 times more powerful than that of Earth.​</p>
            <h2>Rings</h2>
            <p>Neptune has at least five main rings and four prominient ring arcs that we know of so far.</p>
            <p>Starting near the planet and moving outward, the main rings are named Galle, Leverrier, Lassell, Arago and Adams.</p>
            <p>The rings are thought to be relatively young and short-lived.</p>
            <h2>Moons</h2>
            <p>Neptune has 14 known moons.</p>
            <p>Neptune's largest moon Triton was discovered on October 10, 1846, by William Lassell, just 17 days after Johann Gottfried Galle discovered the planet.</p>
            <p>Since Neptune was named for the Roman god of the sea, its moons are named for various lesser sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology.</p>
            <p>Triton is the only large moon in the solar system that circles its planet in a direction opposite to the planet's rotation (a retrograde orbit), which suggests that it may once have been an independent object that Neptune captured.</p>
            <p>Triton is extremely cold, with surface temperatures around minus 391 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 235 degrees Celsius).</p>
            <p>And yet, despite this deep freeze at Triton, Voyager 2 discovered geysers spewing icy material upward more than 5 miles (8 kilometers).</p>
            <p>Triton's thin atmosphere, also discovered by Voyager, has been detected from Earth several times since, and is growing warmer, but scientists do not yet know why.</p>
            <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
            <p>Neptune's environment is not conducive to life as we know it.</p>
            <p>The temperatures, pressures and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.</p>
